# GA registration success-rate research (2026-07-15)

## Current funnel

Latest 100-slot production run `29347583690`:

```text
100 fresh GA runners
  37 denied before touching signup
  63 live probes
    50 reached collector result|0
      36 CreateAccount strict success
      12 fresh-rechallenge absolute timeout
       2 explicit post-proof riskBlock
    12 pre-proof explicit riskBlock
     1 collector result|-1
  36 created, 34 Graph healthy
```

Reported rates must keep their denominator:

- raw strict yield: `36/100 = 36%`;
- live-probe strict rate: `36/63 = 57.1%`;
- strict rate after accepted proof: `36/50 = 72%`;
- Graph health after creation: `34/36 = 94.4%`.

The previous 100-slot run `29338532443` produced 20 strict / 18 Graph healthy.
The gain came from both more usable egresses and a higher accepted-proof rate;
workflow conclusion alone is not a registration metric.

## Decisive bottlenecks

1. Azure egress family is the largest pre-captcha cause. The expanded denylist
   removes 27 of 30 explicit risk blocks in the joined two-run sample while
   preserving every observed strict success.
2. The largest remaining technical loss is not the first hold. Twelve of the
   latest 50 accepted proofs received a fresh HumanCaptcha but exhausted the
   old 60-second/two-round recovery path.
3. The online ADS route still uses a 22-second warmup, 9.5-12.5 second physical
   hold, up to three presses, and only two outer fresh rounds. The locally
   reproduced exact-release route uses a 6.5-second physical hold, an eight
   server-challenge budget, and has a verified two-fresh-challenge
   `CreateAccount 200` sample.
4. Two created accounts failed the immediate Graph stage. Account creation and
   mailbox health must remain separate counters.

## First controlled change

The workflow now pins `release_5s_success_baseline` and
`release_5s_success_attempt2` to private source
`00b68437e041cbdcee2be209a18d7a5592f4c2dd` instead of the unrelated default
source ref. Each fresh runner receives a distinct deterministic Cloak
fingerprint seed while all exact-release timing and proof parameters remain
unchanged.

Run this as a small GA-own-IP experiment before replacing the current online
ADS production variant:

```text
variant=release_5s_success_attempt2
runtime_mode=legacy
network_mode=ga_own_ip
coordinator_mode=entry
egress_prefix_denylist=4.,13.,20.,40.,52.,68.
node_slots_json=[1..20]
max_parallel=5
slot_stagger_seconds=12
per_ip_max_registrations=1
```

`runtime_mode=legacy` is intentional for the first comparison: the exact
source pins CloakBrowser 0.3.32, while the current prebuilt cache contains
0.4.8. Cache migration should be a separate variable after the captcha path is
measured.
